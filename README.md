# whitelist-dApp




This is a whitelist project for an upcoming NFT collection I'll will be making and deploying soon.




This gives early supporters access to a whitelist for my collection, so here I am creating a whitelist dapp for Crypto Devs NFT Collection




It uses frameworks and libraries like hardhat, ether.js, web3modal, Alchemy, nextjs and others...
